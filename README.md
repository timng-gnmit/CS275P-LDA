Much of this code is derived from [onlineldavb](https://github.com/blei-lab/onlineldavb). In particular, much of the LDA class functionality is based on the OnlineLDA class functions, but we did not have a corpus or document class. We built and tested on the BBC News Archive [(Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hgultekin/bbcnewsarchive) data set, which was initially provided by Derek Greene on the [ML Resources](http://mlg.ucd.ie/datasets/bbc.html#) website but cleaned up in the downloadable .csv on Kaggle.
